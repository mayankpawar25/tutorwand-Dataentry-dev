                        <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
                        <p>TutorWand Inc. (“TutorWand,” “us,” or “we”) owns and operates the TutorWand™ web and mobile-based platform (“TutorWand Platform” or “Platform”). The Platform helps teachers save time in conducting and grading exams and gives students more immediate feedback on work submitted.</p>
                        <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of your personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”), and we have provided this policy to inform the teachers and school personnel (together, “Teachers”), their students (“Students”), and the parents or guardians of Students (“Parents”) who use the TutorWand Platform of the types of information we collect, and the ways in which we will use, disclose and protect such Personal Information. Teachers, Students, and Parents to whom this policy applies are referred to herein as a “User” or “you.”)</p>
                        <p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into and part of our Terms of Use.</p>
                        <p>BY ACCESSING OR USING THE TutorWand PLATFORM, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4>2. Personal Information Defined</h4>
                        We may collect information often referred to as “Personal Data,” “Personal Information,” or “personally identifiable information” (collectively “Personal Information”) when you use the TutorWand Platform. Personal Information is any information that can be used to identify or contact you as an individual.
                        <hr>

                        <h4>3. Personal Information You Provide</h4>
                        <p><b>(a) Teachers</b></p>
                        <p>When you are a Teacher and decide to use the TutorWand Platform, you must provide us with the Personal Information necessary to create an account. This includes information such as your first and last name, email address, school name, grade(s) and subject matter taught. We use this information to create your account, set up your classroom and allow you to see the answers to assignments that your Students submit to you. We may also use your email address to send you product updates or other information that may be of interest to you when you sign up to receive such information.</p>
                        <p>If you are using certain services provided by TutorWand through the Platform which are only available for a fee (“Paid Services”), you will be asked to provide payment information in the form of a credit card. All payment information is provided through the Platform to our third-party payment processor only, and TutorWand has no access to your payment information.</p>

                        <p><b>(b) Students and Parents</b></p>
                        <p>Students must provide a email id in order to use the TutorWand Platform for the first time. Students then provide [Optional] their names and contact information, which may include email address, and phone numbers. When using the TutorWand Platform under the direction of their Teacher, Students also provide us with pictures of the answers to assignments. These pictures may include the Student’s first and last name, school, grade, assignment questions and answers, and the Student’s handwriting. We use Student Personal Information only to grade the assignments using our grading and reporting solution and to provide the grades to the Student, the Student’s Teacher, and the Student’s Parent. We may also use such Personal Information to fix issues and provide support to Students when they encounter problems with the Platform, and to send communications relevant to assignment or classroom, to maintain historical learning records for use by the Student, or as otherwise specifically described in this policy. We also may use such information, on a non-personally-identifiable basis, to improve the Platform.</p>

                        <p>TutorWand complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and collects only minimally required Personal Information from Students in order to operate the TutorWand Platform.</p>
                        <p>If you allow Students under the age of 13 to use the TutorWand Platform, the Teacher is responsible for obtaining verifiable parental consent prior to allowing such Students to use the TutorWand Platform. TutorWand will otherwise fully manage its compliance obligations with COPPA.</p>
                        <p>Parents and eligible Students must work directly with their school or district to review or modify Personal Information in their education record that may be stored on the TutorWand Platform. We will then work with Parents and Teachers together to facilitate these requests, which should be sent to us at support@TutorWand.com.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4>4. Personal Information We Collect Automatically</h4>
                        <p>When you use the TutorWand Platform, our servers automatically record information sent from your browser, some of which might be Personal Information. We use this information to monitor, analyze use of and administer the Platform, and to better tailor it to your needs and those of other users.</p>
                        <p>To collect this information, we use certain technologies including:</p>
                        <p><b>(a) Cookies</b></p>
                        <p>A cookie is a small data file sent from a website or application and stored on your computer or device. Cookies allow us to recognize your browser when you return to our website, and to remember your login information. Cookies also allow us to authenticate you as a user, serve certain features, to better understand how you interact with the TutorWand Platform, to improve the User experience, for session control and to monitor and analyze aggregated usage. Most browsers allow visitors to a website to control cookies, including to detect some cookies, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. Please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, certain parts of the TutorWand Platform may not function correctly. To learn more about browser cookies, including how to manage or delete them, look in the Tools, Help or similar section of your web browser, or visit allaboutcookies.org.</p>
                        <p><b>(b) Local Storage</b></p>
                        <p>We may also use, collect, and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches. Like many services, TutorWand uses these technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information, understand your engagement with TutorWand, administer the TutorWand Platform, tailor the TutorWand Platform for Teachers, and to help the TutorWand Platform work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.</p>
                        <p><b>(c) Device Information</b></p>
                        <p>We collect device-specific information such as your device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers. This helps us measure how the TutorWand Platform is performing, improve TutorWand for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you’ve opted in to receive them.</p>
                        <p><b>(d) Server Log Information</b></p>
                        <p>Like most online services, when you use the TutorWand Platform, even if you have not created a TutorWand account or logged in, we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Details of how you used our Platform, such as your activity on the TutorWand Platform, and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Platform
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                IP address
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>(e) Location Information</b></p>
                        <p>When you use the TutorWand Platform, we may collect information about your geographic location, for example based on your IP address. Please note that your IP address can be used to locate you as being in a particular zip code. Other than IP addresses, we will not store or track your location on an ongoing basis. We do not share geolocation data with third parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Platform.</p>
                        <p><b>(f) Integrated Services</b></p>
                        <p>If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third-party social networking service or other service (an “Integrated Service”), such as Facebook, Google, or a similar service permitting single sign-on, TutorWand may also collect Personal Information that is already associated with your Integrated Service account. You may also have the option of sharing additional information with TutorWand through an Integrated Service, as controlled through your settings on that Integrated Service. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, TutorWand will treat the information as Personal Information and will use it in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. Note that if you are logged into both your TutorWand account and your related Integrated Service, the Integrated Service may collect certain information about your activities outside of the Integrated Service site and services.</p>
                        <p>We use third party service providers to assist us in collecting and understanding the information we collect automatically. By using the TutorWand Platform, you agree to our use of these tracking technologies.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4>5. How We May Use Your Personal Information</h4>
                        <p>TutorWand uses your Personal Information as directed by you to provide you with the TutorWand Platform features and services. Users (whether Teachers or Students) retain ownership and control of all Personal Information provided on the TutorWand Platform. TutorWand does not sell or rent Teacher or Student Personal Information to any third-party for any purpose; including for advertising or marketing purposes. Third-party advertising is not permitted on areas where users are required to log in to the TutorWand Platform. TutorWand does not share or provide Personal Information with any third-parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy as set forth below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> 
                                Service Providers: We work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service. We may need to share or provide minimally required information (including Personal Information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example authenticating you as a user, converting handwriting to typed answers so that it can be graded efficiently, maintenance services, sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, analysis of log data, providing customer support, and security. These service providers do not have the right to use your Personal Information we share with them in a manner beyond what is necessary to assist us and must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Testimonials: We post testimonials on our Platform which may contain Personal Information such as the name, photo and/or a video of the individual in the testimonial. We obtain the individual’s consent in advance to ensure we have permission to post this content publicly. To request removal of your Personal Information from our testimonials, please contact us at privacy@TutorWand.com.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Analytics Services: We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the TutorWand Platform is being used. These services may collect, store and use Personal Information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Platform, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Legal Requirements: We may disclose Personal Information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose Personal Information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of TutorWand, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Service or other agreements.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Change of control: In the event that all or a portion of TutorWand or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, Personal Information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third party. This Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your Personal Information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your Personal Information as set forth in this per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). If you do not consent to the use of your Personal Information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                With your consent: Other than the cases above, we won’t disclose your Personal Information for any purpose unless you consent to it.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Non-Personal Information: We may use, transfer and disclose Non-Personal Information (data that does not, on its own, permit direct association with you) for any purpose. For example, we may aggregate and use information regarding activities on our website, Software, and from our other products and services, to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our Platform, website, products and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non-Personal Information.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h4>6. Third party subprocessors</h4>
                        <p>To support delivery of our services, TutorWand engages and uses data processors and they have access to certain student personally identifiable information. Third party subprocessors provide infrastructure support – such as helping us provide technical assistance to customers, send emails, or serving the website. Prior to engaging any third party subprocessors, TutorWand performs due diligence to evaluate their privacy, security, and confidentiality practices. Below is a list of our subprocessors of student personally identifiable information:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Microsoft Web Services</li>
                            <li>Auth0</li>
                            <li>Google</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>As TutorWand grows and changes, this list might change. Please check back frequently for updates.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4>7. Security</h4>
                        <p>TutorWand uses commercially reasonable information security safeguards to protect its databases and servers against risks of loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper disclosure of data. We store data in cloud-based environments that use firewalls and other industry-standard protections in an effort to prevent access from outside intruders. We also encrypt the data in transit, require unique account credentials and limit data access. Not all security risks are reasonably foreseeable, however, and TutorWand is not responsible for the consequences of security incidents that are not reasonably foreseeable and not reasonably within its control.</p>
                        <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT REGULAR EMAIL IS NOT A SECURE MEANS FOR TRANSMITTING CREDIT CARD INFORMATION OR ANY INFORMATION YOU WISH TO KEEP PRIVATE AND SECURE.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4>8. How We Protect Your Personal Information</h4>
                        <p>TutorWand segregates certain Personal Information and other information about your use of the TutorWand Platform into separate databases, some of which can be accessed only by a limited number of employees. Your TutorWand account is protected by your authentication credentials. You can help us protect against unauthorized access to your account by keeping your authentication credentials secret at all times. </p>
                        <p>We restrict access to Personal Information to authorized TutorWand employees, agents or independent contractors who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4>09. How You Can Access and Modify Your Personal Information</h4>
                        <p>If you would like to review, correct, update or request that we delete Personal Information you have provided to us, you may do so by emailing us at support@TutorWand.com. Parents and eligible Students must work directly with their school or district to review or modify Personal Information in their education record that may be stored on the TutorWand Platform.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4>10. Opt Out</h4>
                        <p>We do not send marketing emails or communications to Students, and we do not share Teacher or Student Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
                        <p>You may sign up to receive email updates about our products, and you may opt out of receiving emails from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link found at the bottom of each email, or you may email us at unsubscribe@TutorWand.com. If you have opted out of receiving promotional emails from us, we may still send essential communications, such as legal notices or password change information to you as needed.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4>11. Data Retention</h4>
                        <p>We retain your Personal Information as long as you maintain an active account with TutorWand, and for as long as we need it to make the TutorWand Platform available to you. You may terminate your account at any time, and we will then deactivate your account and delete your related Personal Information. Upon request at any time, we will securely delete your Personal Information from our databases and operational stores within 30 days, noting however that backups containing Personal Information may take longer to delete. We will retain de-identified data for the purposes described above.</p>
                        <p>Please note that the TutorWand Platform will not work properly without some Personal Information, so if your Personal Information is deleted, you may not be able to continue to use the Platform or all of its features.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4>12. Notice to California Residents</h4>
                        <p>Currently, various browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to web sites visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting. TutorWand does not track its users over time and across third-party websites and does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4>13. Updates to this Privacy Policy</h4>
                        <p>We may change this Privacy Policy in the future. When we do, we will post a notice within the product and provide other notifications as required by law. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify the account holder via the email address we have in our records, and changes will become effective when accepted by that contact on behalf of their authorized employees. Non-material changes will become effective when posted in TutorWand. The “last updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy indicates the effective date of when the Policy was last revised.</p>
                        <hr>
